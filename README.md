PayoffPilot is a comprehensive iOS application that empowers users to eliminate debt strategically through proven payoff methods. Built with transparency and motivation at its core, PayoffPilot transforms the overwhelming journey of debt elimination into an actionable, visual, and encouraging experience.

## 🎯 The Problem

Millions of people struggle with debt, but most debt payoff tools are either:
- Too simplistic (basic calculators)
- Too complex (overwhelming spreadsheets) 
- Not motivating (just numbers, no encouragement)
- Not strategic (no method comparison)

**PayoffPilot solves this by combining proven financial strategies with modern UX design.**

## 🧮 How the Math Works

### Debt Avalanche Algorithm
```
1. Sort debts by interest rate (highest first)
2. Calculate minimum payments for all debts
3. Apply extra payment to highest-rate debt
4. When debt is eliminated, roll payment to next highest rate
5. Repeat until debt-free
```

### Debt Snowball Algorithm  
```
1. Sort debts by balance (smallest first)
2. Calculate minimum payments for all debts
3. Apply extra payment to smallest balance
4. When debt is eliminated, roll payment to next smallest
5. Repeat until debt-free
```

### Real Example Comparison
**Scenario**: 3 debts, $500 extra monthly payment

| Debt | Balance | Rate | Minimum |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| Credit Card A | $2,500 | 24% | $75 |
| Credit Card B | $8,000 | 18% | $160 |
| Car Loan | $15,000 | 6% | $280 |

**Results**:
- **Avalanche**: 31 months, $4,200 total interest
- **Snowball**: 33 months, $4,800 total interest  
- **Difference**: Avalanche saves $600 and 2 months

*PayoffPilot shows this comparison instantly as you enter your debts.*
