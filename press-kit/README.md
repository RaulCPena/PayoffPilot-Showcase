## 🎯 The Story

### The Problem PayoffPilot Solves
Every year, Americans pay over $120 billion in credit card interest alone. Most people with debt lack a clear strategy, using inefficient payoff methods that cost them thousands in unnecessary interest and years of additional payments.

Existing solutions are either:
- **Too Simple**: Basic calculators that don't provide strategy
- **Too Complex**: Overwhelming spreadsheets that intimidate users
- **Not Motivating**: Pure numbers without psychological support
- **Not Comparative**: No way to see different approaches side-by-side

### The PayoffPilot Solution
PayoffPilot combines proven debt elimination strategies (Snowball and Avalanche methods) with modern mobile UX design, creating the first debt payoff app that is simultaneously mathematically accurate, psychologically motivating, and beautifully designed.

**Key Innovation**: Side-by-side strategy comparison showing users exactly how much time and money they can save by choosing the optimal approach for their situation.

## 👨‍💻 Founder Story

### Raul Pena - Founder & Developer

**Background**: Software engineer with a passion for personal finance and helping others achieve financial freedom.

**The Origin Story**: 
*"For years, I helped friends and family create debt payoff spreadsheets. I'd spend hours setting up complex formulas to compare Snowball vs Avalanche methods. Every time, people were amazed by the insights - 'I had no idea I could save $3,000 by switching strategies!' But spreadsheets are intimidating and hard to maintain. I realized there had to be a better way."*

**The Mission**: 
*"PayoffPilot isn't just another finance app. It's a tool for empowerment. When people see their path to debt freedom clearly visualized, with real dates and real savings amounts, it transforms their relationship with money. Suddenly, debt elimination becomes achievable instead of overwhelming."*

**Technical Expertise**: 
- 10+ years in software development
- Specializes in iOS development and user experience design
- Previously worked on financial technology applications
- Advocates for privacy-first, user-centric design
