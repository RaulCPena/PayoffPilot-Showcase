## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Debt Snowball Method

### How It Works
1. **List all debts** from smallest balance to largest balance
2. **Make minimum payments** on all debts
3. **Apply all extra money** to the smallest debt
4. **When smallest debt is paid off**, roll that entire payment to the next smallest debt
5. **Repeat** until all debts are eliminated

### Mathematical Example
**Your Debts:**
- Credit Card A: $1,500 balance, 22% APR, $45 minimum
- Credit Card B: $4,200 balance, 18% APR, $105 minimum  
- Car Loan: $12,000 balance, 6% APR, $220 minimum
- **Extra Payment Available:** $300/month

**Snowball Order:** Card A ‚Üí Card B ‚Üí Car Loan

**Timeline:**
- Month 6: Credit Card A paid off ($345/month total)
- Month 18: Credit Card B paid off ($450/month total)  
- Month 42: Car Loan paid off ($670/month total)
- **Total Time:** 42 months
- **Total Interest:** $6,240

### Psychological Benefits

### How It Works
1. **List all debts** from highest interest rate to lowest interest rate
